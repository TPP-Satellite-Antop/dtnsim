The bundles with the following ids have been sent: 

--------------------
The following bundles were received by the destination node with the following delivery time: 

--------------------
That means, that overall -nan (0/0) were delivered successfully
--------------------
Further, every bundle was sent the following amount of times: 

--------------------
Overall, the computation required 0 calls to RUCoP, which took 0 seconds and 0 calls to CGR, which took 0 seconds
--------------------
To achieve this results, the following routing decisions have been taken: 
Node 1: 
Node 2: 
Node 3: 
Node 4: 
Node 5: 
Node 6: 
Node 7: 
Node 8: 
Node 9: 
Node 10: 
Node 11: 
Node 12:
